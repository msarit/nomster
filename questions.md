1. How do I change the field name (simple form gem)?
2. When generating a migration file, how does it know which database to alter? "alter_places_add_lat_and_lng" => Stupid, there's just one database
3. Why do we need a controller for comments? Is a seperate controller necessary for each database table?

Eureka: "params" refers to URL parameters
